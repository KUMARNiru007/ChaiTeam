## 📖 About

ChaiTeam is a collaborative web project built for **Chaicode cohort** to streamline team coordination, task management, and knowledge sharing. Our mission is to create a lightweight but powerful platform where every team member can:

- **Communicate**: Share updates, chat, and centralize discussions.
- **Organize**: Create, assign, and track tasks with clear visibility.
- **Share Knowledge**: Post guides, snippets, and resources so everyone learns from each other.
- **Grow Together**: Give and receive feedback, track progress, and improve over time.

We designed ChaiTeam with simplicity and flexibility in mind — it's intuitive enough for newcomers, but modular enough to support more advanced workflows as our team matures.
